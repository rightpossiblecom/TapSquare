Good.
This one is clean, safe, and different from the productivity apps.

We just need to soften this line:

> “Improves reaction speed.”

In store positioning, we’ll say:

> “Test your reaction speed.”
> or
> “A fast-paced reaction tapping game.”

Avoid performance or cognitive improvement claims.

Now let’s structure it properly.

# 🟦 TapSquare – Simple App Plan

## 1️⃣ App Goal

TapSquare is a simple reaction game where random squares appear on the screen, and the user must tap them before they disappear.

The focus is:

* Fast reflexes
* Simple gameplay
* Quick sessions
* Score improvement

No complex mechanics.
No multiplayer.
No accounts.

---

## 2️⃣ What The App Does

* Random square appears in different positions
* Square disappears after short time (e.g., 1–2 seconds)
* User taps before it disappears
* Score increases for successful taps
* Game ends after missed taps or time limit
* Shows high score

That’s it.

---

## 3️⃣ What The App Does NOT Do

* No gambling mechanics
* No rewards with real money
* No cognitive improvement claims
* No data collection
* No multiplayer (v1)
* No ads required at launch

It’s just an arcade mini-game.

---

# 4️⃣ Core User Story

> As a user, I open TapSquare, start a round, tap as many squares as I can before missing, see my score, and try again to beat it.

Fast loop. Addictive but simple.

---

# 5️⃣ App Structure

## 🏠 1. Home Screen

* Game title
* High score display
* “Start Game” button

Minimal.

---

## 🎮 2. Game Screen

* Clean background
* One square appears randomly
* Countdown or time bar (optional)
* Score displayed at top

Game Modes (choose one for MVP):

* 30-second mode (recommended)
  OR
* 3-miss limit mode

Keep it simple.

---

## 🏆 3. Results Screen

After game ends:

* Final score
* High score
* “Play Again” button
* Share score button (optional)

---

## ⚙️ 4. Settings Page (Minimal)

* Sound on/off
* Vibration on/off
* Reset high score
* Privacy Policy
* App version

That’s enough for Play Store completeness.

---

# 6️⃣ One Nice-to-Have Feature

### 🎨 Increasing Difficulty

As score increases:

* Squares appear faster
* Squares get slightly smaller

This adds progression without complexity.

Still very lightweight to implement.

---

# 7️⃣ MVP Scope (3–4 Hour Realistic Build)

### Must Have

* Random square generation
* Tap detection
* Score counter
* End condition
* High score storage (local)
* Simple start/restart flow

### Nice to Have

* Gradual speed increase
* Share score button

---

# 8️⃣ Play Store Positioning

Use:

* “Fast reaction game”
* “Test your reflexes”
* “Quick arcade challenge”
* “Simple tap game”

Avoid:

* Brain training
* Cognitive enhancement
* Improves intelligence
* Scientifically proven
* ADHD improvement claims

Keep it arcade category.

---

# Strategic Comparison

Compared to your previous ideas:

* ✅ Lowest policy risk (pure game)
* ✅ Very easy to test
* ✅ Highly replayable
* ⚠️ Competitive category (many simple games exist)

But it’s extremely safe.
